### Notes and question re: Preparation

**Security Operations Center kap. 7**

> Many breaches discovered are caused by a system having a known vulnerability exploited before it is properly patched.

- Also chapter links inventory controls with active discovery tools and mitigating
- Mentions Threat Feeds, which should be integrated into SIEM and/or organizations
- You need to stay up-to-date on current threats, and be able to search for signs in your own network

**Security Operations Center 11. Reacting to events and Incidents:**

>Let’s start by talking a little bit about events, because they might not be what you think they are. As discussed earlier, events are really things we observe based on artifacts we have that you can use to indicate what may have happened in the recent (or in some cases, distant) past. **For most new SOCs**, this tends to mean focusing on the events that come in the form of **logs generated by assets and security controls throughout the organization, or collated events that analyze multiple logs in the context of each other**. As a result, SOC members spend a lot of time working on building and tuning security log management and **security information and event management (SIEM)** to help collect and interpret such **logs in real time or over historical periods**. Unfortunately, events in the form of automated logs or alerts generated by SIEMs represent the smaller portion of events relevant to security incidents in most organizations.

**Crafting the Infosec Playbook kap. 6 Operationalize!**

> You will need at least one dedicated and full-time human to analyze your security event data. ... For organizations with too few dedicated security analysts, the actual available headcount may define with what frequency and what volume alerts can be handled per day or week. Ideally, organizations are staffed to run and process all defined reports, with enough flexibility for new reports to be created and analyzed.

- Organizations in Denmark does not usually have the luxury of dedicated resources – until it happens

*With regard to analysts and staffing, your options essentially boil down to:*

- Paying a managed security service a regular subscription fee to “do your security,” with little to no context about your network; the service might, however, handle a broad spectrum of security beyond incident response (e.g., vulnerability scan‐ ning)
- Tasking a part-time “security person” to work on a best-effort security monitor‐ ing system (e.g., a SIEM) when they have time
- Hiring a sufficient number of security analysts and tailoring your security opera‐ tions to your business requirements
- Calling in an emergency response team after your organization has been compromised
