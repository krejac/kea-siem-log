### Notes and question re: Preparation

Data Driven Security chap. 6:   

    > - **Data visualizations communicate complexity quickly**. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, and so on) exist to describe and simplify data but tend to remove subtleties that exist. It’s possible to communicate millions of data points in seconds while minimizing the loss of detail and resolution through visualization.   
    > - **Data visualizations enable recognition of latent patterns**. Patterns that would never be apparent using statistical methods or scanning the data may be revealed through visualization. When data is visually presented, patterns in a single variable or relationships across many variables may leap off the screen.   
    > - **Data visualizations enable quality control on the data**. Mistakes and errors in data collection or preparation can often be revealed through visualization. Data visualizations can serve as a good and quick sanity check on your work.   
    > **Data visualizations can serve as a muse**. It’s been said that most breakthroughs in science didn’t start with a “Eureka!” but instead with a “Huh, that’s odd.” Laying out the data visually can give you a new perspective and help facilitate your thinking and discovery processes.   

Data Driven Security chap. 10:   

    > **A Dashboard Is Not a Report** ... However, the top-level view should be designed solely to give the viewer situational awareness of the desired task   
    > - **A Dashboard Is Not an Art Show**    
    > - **Take Care with Colors** - talks about printing, but color blindness is a real problem    
    > - **Use Fonts Wisely** - be sure to select one that scales consistently, supports variable width text, and has fixed-width numbers    
    > - **No One Dashboard to Rule Them All** - An iterative process    

## Noter fra undervisningen

**Slide. 10**

*Konferencer*: FloCon 2021. Zeek Week 2021. IEEE. <- Kig også historisk; mange gode gamle præsentationer.

*Værktøjer vi bør kende*:   
- [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) - Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.   
- [afterglow](http://afterglow.sourceforge.net/) -  is a tool which facilitates the process of generating graphs.   
- [Brim](https://www.brimsecurity.com/) - A new way to browse, store and archive your [network] logs.
